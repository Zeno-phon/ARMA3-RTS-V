Here's a draft of the introduction we might post.  I didn't include things like a download links section, contact info for feedback etc, so it's still incomplete.  We also need to update and correct the github page so an potential contributors can fork/pull easily.  If anything looks wrong or there's more you want to add, just say so.

RTS V is a 32 player PvP mission spanning all of Altis, in which players work as a team in a boots-on-the-ground twist on traditional real time strategy games.  Take strategic points on the island to earn resources for your team and money for yourself.  Create buildings when you are the commander to allow your teammates to purchase soldiers, vehicles, and aircraft with which to defeat the enemy team.  Lead your custom platoon of AI soldiers and vehicles, or take control of your most powerful asset directly to engage other players.

Despite a long development time and rigorous testing, RTS V is still in the Beta stage of development.  This means that most major features are functional, but numerous minor features and tweaks are unfinished.  There are undoubtedly bugs and issues we have yet to discover, so your bug reports and feedback are vital to improving the mission.  We are also interested in subjective feedback about the design and gameplay of the mission.

We present a list of the major known issues and an estimated time we can fix them.  We will be updating this list as new issues are reported or fixed.  For the sanity of the development team, please do not report issues that we are already aware of.

Known Issues
    Building visuals
        we are trying workarounds in MP now
    Client synch delay on mission start
        this appears to be server/client/ping dependent
        As a workaround, restart the mission once or twice; this seems to reduce the lag
        this affects every mission with server-client scripting
    Individual upgrades/techs are missed or not functional
        We'll fix this system when we add more techs

Due to the complexity of the mission's features (we have thousands of lines of code written specifically for this mission), we invite players to join the development process as either a tester (you'll test and fill out bug reports in a semi-serious fashion) or a coder (you'll track down bugs or add minor features).  No prior experience with mission making or programming is required, just a desire to help and learn.  Also, feel free to fork the project on github and commit fixes; if your code works, we'll merge it and credit you as a developer of the mission.
